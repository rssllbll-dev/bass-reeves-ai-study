Constitutional AI Research Framework: Accuracy, Verification, and Community Sovereignty

# Constitutional AI Research Framework: Accuracy, Verification, and Community Sovereignty

## Overview

This repository contains the research framework and supporting materials for "The Limits of AI in Constitutional Scholarship: Accuracy, Verification, and Community Sovereignty" - a systematic study of AI performance in constitutional research with emphasis on community sovereignty and digital rights protection.

**SSRN Paper ID:** 5496718  
**Available at:** https://ssrn.com/abstract=5496718

The research examines differential AI performance across content types, revealing 94% accuracy for constitutional doctrine versus 69% accuracy for biographical details, with significant implications for legal scholarship and community cultural property rights.

## Research Questions

- Can artificial intelligence accelerate constitutional research while maintaining academic integrity and community sovereignty?
- How do AI accuracy patterns vary across different types of legal content?
- What constitutional protections are needed for community cultural property in AI systems?

## Methodology

### Empirical Analysis
- **AI Claims Analysis**: Systematic verification of 127 AI-generated claims across constitutional doctrine, biographical details, and legal citations
- **Federal Court Documentation**: Longitudinal analysis of 287 federal court cases (1865-1945) involving marginalized historical figures
- **Statistical Methods**: Chi-square tests, binomial analysis, intercoder reliability assessment (κ = 0.82)

### Community Sovereignty Integration
- **CARE Principles**: Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, Ethics implementation
- **OCAP® Framework**: Ownership, Control, Access, Possession application
- **Constitutional Equal Protection**: Analysis for systematic AI bias patterns
- **First Amendment Protection**: Academic freedom frameworks for community cultural property

## Key Findings

- **Constitutional Doctrine**: 94% AI accuracy rate
- **Biographical Details**: 69% AI accuracy rate  
- **Historical Claims**: 31% fabrication rate requiring intensive verification
- **Bias Patterns**: Systematic underrepresentation of marginalized historical figures
- **Community Impact**: Need for sovereignty-based verification protocols

## Data Access and Community Sovereignty

### Ethical Framework
This research follows community sovereignty principles:

- **Community Consent**: All materials involving marginalized historical figures developed with community sovereignty protocols
- **Cultural Property Rights**: Recognition of community ownership over cultural narratives
- **Benefit Sharing**: Research outcomes designed to serve community interests
- **Legal Protection**: Constitutional frameworks protecting community sovereignty

### Data Availability
- **Public Materials**: Constitutional doctrine analysis, federal court metadata
- **Community-Controlled**: Materials involving Bass Reeves and marginalized historical figures
- **Restricted Access**: Full biographical datasets require community partnership protocols

## Usage Instructions

### Prerequisites
- R 4.3.0 or higher
- Python 3.9 or higher
- Required R packages: `tidyverse`, `caret`, `irr`, `ggplot2`
- Required Python packages: `pandas`, `sklearn`, `transformers`

### Running the Analysis

1. **Clone Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rssllbll-dev/bass-reeves-ai-study.git
   cd bass-reeves-ai-study
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```r
   # In R
   install.packages(c("tidyverse", "caret", "irr", "ggplot2"))
   ```

3. **Run Accuracy Analysis**
   ```bash
   cd analysis/
   Rscript accuracy-analysis.R
   ```

4. **Generate Statistical Tests**
   ```bash
   Rscript statistical-tests.R
   ```

5. **Community Sovereignty Verification**
   ```bash
   Rscript verification-workflow.R
   ```

## Constitutional Framework

### Equal Protection Analysis
The research addresses systematic AI bias as potential Equal Protection violations through:
- Differential accuracy measurement across demographic categories
- Legal remedy frameworks for algorithmic discrimination
- Community sovereignty as constitutional protection mechanism

### First Amendment Considerations  
Academic freedom protections for:
- Independent scholarly research on AI bias
- Community-controlled historical recovery projects
- Critical analysis of AI systems in legal contexts

## Bass Reeves Case Study

This repository includes comprehensive materials for the Bass Reeves historical recovery case study:

- **Methodology**: Community-sovereignty approach to historical research
- **Sources**: Federal court documentation (1865-1907)
- **Verification**: AI claim validation against primary sources
- **Community Protocols**: Sovereignty-based research frameworks
